					<h3 class="major">A lifetime before programming!</h3>
					<p>Hi! I am Diego Dimitroff Petcoff. I am 33 years old and I was born in the city of Resistencia
						Chaco, Argentina.</p>

					<p>Upon graduating from high school I began to study Law in the city of Corrientes - Argentina.
						In 2014 I graduated as a lawyer and began to practice the profession.
						I could say that I spent almost a century dedicating myself to the legal profession!
						I gave classes at the Popular University of the city of Resistencia on traffic laws.
						I was able to tour the interior of the province of Chaco giving classes on criminal and civil
						liability to tertiary level teachers.</p>
					<p>I began practicing the profession in a liberal way in the city of Resistencia and I was lucky
						enough to teach many junior lawyers about the world of law.</p>
					<p>But I didn't just meddle in the law! During that period I started a personal business that had
						nothing to do with law, and that continues to work today!
						ACTITUD FUNCIONAL GYM, which has been in the city of Resistencia for years, is one of my great
						prides.
						I've been in charge of the administration, human resources acquisitions, events and network
						management!
						That's how it is! It could be said that I was lucky to acquire enough experience in teamwork,
						leading a group and knowing how to manage it (Currently it is being managed by my family since I
						am no longer living in Argentina).</p>

					<h3 class="major">My beginnings in the world of programming</h3>
					<p>In the year 2020, in the midst of a global pandemic,
						I made the decision to make a resounding change in my career AND LIFE!
						I did a work & holiday visa in Sweden and I was there for about a year and three months! </p>
					<p>This experience allowed me to learn to speak English, make new friends and discover the world! At
						that time I made a friend who was in the testing work area, and that idea was resonating in my
						head. A few days later I found out how and where to start studying programming and I did it
						without hesitation!
						<b>As you can see, my philosophy of life is a bit extreme!
						I am aware of what I want and I never stop Fighting for my dreams!</b> 
						Thus, it was that I managed to do an internship in Web analytics area in a Swedish company
						called Aumla.
						Although it was a few months, it helped me a lot to meddle a little in that world.</p>
					<p>Meanwhile all this, I studied, worked, traveled the world and learned!
						The web programming career I started consisted of separate FRONTEND and BACKEND studios.
						Already having these resources, I started an internship at NO COUNTRY in July of this year (2022), which lasted 5 months where I had the opportunity to work in a team of four programmers (all juniors just like me). I worked in Backend.
						The logic of this internship is to bring junior programmers closer to their first IT job, 
						and for this purpose it selects the profiles that had the best performance.</p>
					<p>Me siento feliz de contarles que quede en el seleccionado de NO COUNTRY y 
						actualmente me encuentro realizando esta segunda pasant√≠a, obteniendo experiencia en un ambiente de trabajo real!!</p>
