					<h3 class="major">INTRODUCCION</h3>
					<p>Work done throughout the Backend bootcamp.
						It is a simple application with E commerce format, where you can add elements such as text and a
						price..
						The user who enters can create his account by placing his personal information and his email,
						when this
						happens the administrator will receive an email with that information
						Added products can be edited as well as deleted. Objects can be searched according to ID in the
						filter found on the main page or in the "filters" tab. On the other hand, the application has a
						MESSAGE CENTER, where the person can leave a message. This information, unlike what happens with
						saved products, is stored in a folder. The intention is to be able to use various ways of saving
						in the project (mongoose and filesystem). All the information is updated through the socket io
						packet in real time, which I understand makes it more dynamic. The application compresses the
						information from the message center for greater speed and it is deployed using all the cores of
						the processor that is acting (cluster). It can start running through different commands so that
						different databases can be used and it is adapted by building a factory that allows it to be
						scalable to be able to use various types of data voids.</p>


					<h3 class="major">TECHNOLOGY USED</h3>
					<p>The project has a base written with javascript, with MVP mode (Model view controller). NODE JS is
						used. and ExpressJs. For the front template engines are used, in this case HBS was used. For the
						practice of the message center, Websockets were used.
						In regards to the DBS. Mongo DB is used, with the moongose ​​package that makes it compatible
						with node js.
						Throughout the project different types of logs were used and the project is deployed on Heroku.
						The emails that were used were made through nodemailer..</p>
